## Project Summary
This project demonstrates how a legacy monolithic e-commerce system can be advanced using Django and basic DevOps practices. 
The PoC improves modularity, maintainability, and deployment reliability while providing core website pages (Home, Products, About, Contact). 
It serves as a foundation for future scaling, automation, and cloud deployment.
